# README: Data Structures in Python

## Overview
This repo provides a summary of the basic Python data structures covered in the Miuul Bootcamp. These structures are fundamental to Python programming and include Numbers, Strings, Boolean, List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set. In the repository, information about the structures is provided, structure methods are used and examples are given.

## What I Learned ðŸ“š

- **Numbers**: 
  - Integer, Float, and Complex types for numerical operations.
- **Strings**: 
  - Immutable text data with methods for manipulation like `.upper()` and `.replace()`.
- **Boolean**: 
  - True/False values for logic-based programming.
- **Lists**: 
  - Ordered and mutable collections with operations like `.append()` and `.pop()`.
- **Dictionaries**: 
  - Key-value pairs for mapping data efficiently with `.keys()` and `.update()`.
- **Tuples**: 
  - Immutable, ordered collections.
- **Sets**: 
  - Unordered collections with unique items and operations like `.union()` and `.intersection()`.

### Final Thoughts âœ¨
Understanding these data structures is essential for writing clean, efficient, and scalable Python code. Mastering them provides a strong foundation for tackling more advanced programming challenges.
