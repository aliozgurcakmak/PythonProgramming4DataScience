     - **Array Attributes**: Exploring attributes like `ndim`, `shape`, `size`, and `dtype`.
     - **Reshaping**: Techniques to reshape arrays, such as `reshape`.
     - **Indexing and Slicing**: Selecting elements using indexing and slicing.
     - **Fancy Indexing**: Selecting multiple elements at once using lists or arrays as indices.
     - **Conditions**: Applying conditions to arrays to filter elements.
     - **Math Operations**: Performing basic mathematical operations on arrays.
   - **Pandas**:
     - **Series and DataFrame Operations**: Creating and manipulating Series and DataFrames.
     - **Reading Data**: Loading data from CSV files using `pd.read_csv`.
     - **Quick Look at Data**: Methods like `head`, `tail`, `shape`, `info`, `columns`, `index`, `describe`, and handling missing values.
     - **Selection and Indexing**: Techniques like `iloc`, `loc`, and conditional selection.
     - **Aggregation and Grouping**: Aggregation functions like `count`, `mean`, `sum`, and using `groupby` for grouping data.
     - **Pivot Tables**: Creating pivot tables to summarize data.
     - **Apply and Lambda Functions**: Applying functions to rows or columns using `apply` and lambda functions.
     - **Join Operations**: Merging and concatenating DataFrames.
   - **Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn**:
     - **Categorical Variable Visualization**: Visualizing categorical data using bar plots and count plots.
     - **Numerical Variable Visualization**: Visualizing numerical data using histograms and box plots.
     - **Plot Attributes**: Customizing plots with titles, labels, and grids.
     - **Subplots**: Creating multiple plots in a single figure.
     - **Seaborn Attributes**: Utilizing Seaborn for more advanced visualizations.
   - **Advanced Functional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
     - **Overall View**: Functions to check the overall structure and summary of the DataFrame.
     - **Categorical Variable Analysis**: Summarizing and visualizing categorical variables.
     - **Numerical Variable Analysis**: Summarizing and visualizing numerical variables.
     - **Target Variable Analysis**: Analyzing target variables with respect to categorical and numerical variables.
     - **Correlation Analysis**: Calculating and visualizing correlations, and removing highly correlated variables.
