# Python Exercises from Miuul Data Scientist Bootcamp üêç

## Overview üìã
This repository contains the exercises completed during **Week One** of the Miuul Data Scientist Bootcamp. The exercises focus on foundational Python programming concepts, including data structures, functions, conditions, loops, and comprehensions. Each file demonstrates practical implementations and examples designed to build a strong programming foundation.

## Contents üìö

### 1. **Data Structures** (`dataStructures.py`)
   - **Topics Covered**:
     - **Numbers**: Integer, float, and complex number operations.
     - **Strings**: Slicing, transformations (`upper`, `lower`), and operations like `replace` and `split`.
     - **Booleans**: Boolean logic and comparison operators.
     - **Lists**: Indexing, slicing, adding/removing elements, and methods like `append`, `pop`, and `insert`.
     - **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, querying keys, and methods (`keys`, `values`, `items`).
     - **Tuples**: Immutable data structures and conversion between tuples and lists.
     - **Sets**: Unique, unordered collections and operations like `union`, `intersection`, and `difference`.

### 2. **Functions, Conditions, Loops, and Comprehensions** (`functionsConditionsLoopsComprehensions.py`) 
   - **Functions**:
     - Basics of defining and calling functions.
     - Parameter usage, default arguments, and return statements.
     - Examples include calculating scores and reusable logic.
   - **Conditions**:
     - Implemented `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements for decision-making.
     - Examples for numeric comparisons and handling conditional outputs.
   - **Loops**:
     - Covered `for` and `while` loops with examples for iterating over lists and ranges.
     - Used `break` and `continue` to control loop behavior.
     - Practical examples include salary adjustments and alternating string cases.
   - **Comprehensions**:
     - **List Comprehensions**: Conditional transformations and filtering.
     - **Dictionary Comprehensions**: Creating dynamic dictionaries with concise syntax.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Week One Focus**: Includes all foundational topics covered in the first week of the bootcamp.
- **Real-world Examples**: Practical applications like data transformation, filtering, and reusable code.
- **Efficiency**: Demonstrates Python's advanced features such as comprehensions and reusable functions.
- **Structured Content**: Each topic is well-organized with detailed examples for easy understanding.

## How to Use üöÄ
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Python 3.x on your system.
2. **Run the Files**:
   - Open the `.py` files in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
   - Execute the scripts to explore the outputs and processes.
3. **Experiment**:
   - Modify the examples and test your own inputs to strengthen your skills.

## Final Thoughts üí°
These exercises provide a solid foundation for Python programming, focusing on both basic and intermediate concepts. They are an excellent starting point for beginners or those refreshing their Python skills.
